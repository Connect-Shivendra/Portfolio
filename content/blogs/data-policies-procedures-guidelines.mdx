# Data Policies vs. Procedures vs. Guidelines: Understanding the Differences

Effective data governance requires clear documentation that guides how an organization manages its data assets. However, many organizations struggle with creating the right types of documentation at the appropriate level of detail. Understanding the differences between policies, procedures, and guidelines is essential for developing a coherent data governance framework that balances control with usability.

This article explores the distinctions between these document types, their roles in data governance, and best practices for developing and maintaining them.

## The Documentation Hierarchy

Data governance documentation typically follows a hierarchical structure:

### 1. Policies

**Definition**: Policies are high-level statements that reflect the organization's position, values, and objectives regarding data management. They establish what must be done and why.

**Characteristics**:
- Mandatory compliance
- Broad in scope
- Relatively stable over time
- Approved at executive level
- Focused on "what" and "why"
- Aligned with regulatory requirements
- Typically brief (1-3 pages)

**Purpose**:
- Establish organizational direction
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Define accountability and responsibility
- Set boundaries for acceptable behavior
- Create a foundation for procedures and guidelines

### 2. Standards

**Definition**: Standards are mandatory requirements that provide specific details on how to implement policies. They establish uniform technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices.

**Characteristics**:
- Mandatory compliance
- More specific than policies
- Technical in nature
- Focused on "what" must be done
- Relatively stable but updated more frequently than policies
- Approved at senior management level
- Typically moderate length (3-10 pages)

**Purpose**:
- Ensure consistency across the organization
- Establish technical requirements
- Define specific controls
- Enable interoperability
- Support policy implementation

### 3. Procedures

**Definition**: Procedures are step-by-step instructions that detail how to perform specific activities in compliance with policies and standards.

**Characteristics**:
- Mandatory compliance
- Highly specific and detailed
- Process-oriented
- Focused on "how" to implement
- Updated as processes change
- Approved at departmental level
- Typically detailed (5-20+ pages)

**Purpose**:
- Provide operational guidance
- Ensure consistent execution
- Support training and knowledge transfer
- Enable process repeatability
- Document compliance methods

### 4. Guidelines

**Definition**: Guidelines are recommended (but not mandatory) approaches that provide advice on best practices and suggested methods.

**Characteristics**:
- Discretionary compliance
- Flexible application
- Advisory in nature
- Focused on "how" something could be done
- Updated based on lessons learned
- Approved at operational level
- Variable length based on complexity

**Purpose**:
- Share best practices
- Provide implementation options
- Support decision-making
- Offer practical advice
- Allow for situational adaptation

## Key Differences in the Data Governance Context

Understanding how these document types apply specifically to data governance helps clarify their roles:

### Data Policies vs. Data Procedures

**Data Policies**:
- Define the organization's position on data management
- Establish data ownership and stewardship principles
- Set requirements for data protection and privacy
- Define data classification framework
- Establish data quality expectations

**Example**: "All customer data must be classified according to sensitivity and protected with appropriate controls based on classification level."

**Data Procedures**:
- Provide step-by-step instructions for data management activities
- Detail how to classify data in specific systems
- Specify how to implement data protection controls
- Document data quality measurement processes
- Outline steps for data incident response

**Example**: "To classify customer data, follow these steps: 1) Identify data elements, 2) Apply classification criteria from Appendix A, 3) Document classification in the metadata repository, 4) Implement required controls from the security matrix..."

### Data Standards vs. Data Guidelines

**Data Standards**:
- Establish required data formats and structures
- Define mandatory metadata elements
- Specify required data quality thresholds
- Establish required integration methods
- Define mandatory data lifecycle controls

**Example**: "All customer identifiers must follow the format CUS-[ISO country code]-[10-digit number] and include the mandatory metadata elements listed in Appendix B."

**Data Guidelines**:
- Suggest approaches for data modeling
- Provide advice on data quality improvement
- Offer recommendations for data integration
- Suggest best practices for data analysis
- Provide guidance on tool selection and use

**Example**: "When developing data models for customer information, consider including these recommended attributes for improved analytics capabilities..."

**Solution**:
- Use a template that clearly distinguishes document types
- Review documents against type criteria before approval
- Train document authors on the differences
- Establish clear approval paths for each document type
- Conduct periodic documentation audits

### 2. Documentation Overload

**Pitfall**: Creating too many documents that overwhelm users and become unmanageable.

**Solution**:
- Start with critical areas only
- Consolidate related documents where possible
- Establish documentation priorities

- Regularly review and retire unnecessary documents

### 3. Outdated Documentation

**Pitfall**: Allowing documents to become outdated and irrelevant.

**Solution**:
- Assign document owners responsible for maintenance
- Establish regular review cycles (e.g., annual for policies)
- Implement version control
- Include "last reviewed" dates on all documents
- Create a process for users to flag outdated content

### 4. Impractical Requirements

**Pitfall**: Creating policies and procedures that are difficult or impossible to implement.

**Solution**:
- Involve operational staff in document development
- Test procedures before finalizing
- Consider resource implications of requirements
- Provide implementation support
- Gather feedback on practical challenges
- Be willing to revise based on implementation experience

### 5. Poor Accessibility

**Pitfall**: Making documentation difficult to find or understand.

**Solution**:
- Implement a central documentation repository
- Create clear naming conventions
- Develop a good search capability
- Use consistent formatting and templates
- Create summaries of key points
- Consider multiple formats for different users

## Conclusion

Effective data governance requires a clear hierarchy of documentation that guides organizational behavior while providing practical operational guidance. By understanding the differences between policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, organizations can develop documentation that strikes the right balance between control and usability.

Policies establish the "what" and "why" of data governance, setting organizational direction and requirements. Standards provide specific technical requirements for implementation. Procedures detail the "how" with step-by-step instructions, while guidelines offer flexible best practices and recommendations.

Developing effective documentation requires a structured approach, clear ownership, and ongoing maintenance. By avoiding common pitfalls and following best practices, organizations can create documentation that enhances data governance effectiveness, ensures regulatory compliance, and supports operational excellence.

Remember that documentation is not an end in itself but a means to enable better data management. The ultimate measure of success is not the documentation itself but how effectively it guides organizational behavior to improve data quality, security, and value.
