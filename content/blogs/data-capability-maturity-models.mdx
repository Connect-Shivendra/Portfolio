# Data Capability Maturity Models: Assessing Your Organization's Data Readiness

In today's data-driven business environment, organizations need to understand their current data capabilities and have a clear path for improvement. Data Capability Maturity Models (DCMMs) provide structured frameworks for assessing, benchmarking, and enhancing an organization's ability to create value from data. This article explores key data maturity models, their applications, and practical approaches for using them to drive data transformation.

## Understanding Data Capability Maturity Models

Data Capability Maturity Models are structured frameworks that:

- Define key data management capabilities
- Establish progressive maturity levels for each capability
- Provide assessment criteria and methodologies
