# Cloud Data Architecture: Building for Scale and Flexibility

The migration of data workloads to cloud environments represents one of the most significant shifts in enterprise data architecture in recent years. Cloud-based data architectures offer unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency compared to traditional on-premises approaches. This article explores the key components, patterns, and best practices for designing and implementing effective cloud data architectures that meet modern business requirements.

### Evolution from Traditional Architectures

Understanding the shift from traditional to cloud data architectures:

```python
# Evolution of Data Architecture Approaches
def compare_architecture_approaches():
    traditional = {
        "infrastructure": "Physical or virtualized servers",
        "scaling": "Vertical (scale up) with hardware upgrades",
        "procurement": "Capital expenditure with long cycles",
        "management": "Manual operations and maintenance",
        "integration": "Point-to-point, often tightly coupled",
        "processing": "Primarily batch-oriented",
        "cost_model": "Fixed costs regardless of utilization"
    }
    
    cloud_native = {
        "infrastructure": "Managed services and serverless",
        "scaling": "Horizontal (scale out) with distributed resources",
        "procurement": "Operational expenditure with on-demand provisioning",
        "management": "Automated operations with infrastructure as code",
        "integration": "API-driven, loosely coupled microservices",

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("EventDrivenArchitecture") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Define schema for incoming events
event_schema = StructType([
    StructField("event_id", StringType(), False),
    StructField("event_type", StringType(), False),
    StructField("timestamp", TimestampType(), False),
    StructField("user_id", StringType(), True),
    StructField("properties", MapType(StringType(), StringType()), True)
])

# Read from streaming source
events_stream = spark.readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "broker:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "user_events") \
    .load()

# Parse events
parsed_events = events_stream.select(
    from_json(col("value").cast("string"), event_schema).alias("event")
).select("event.*")

# Process different event types
purchase_events = parsed_events.filter(col("event_type") == "purchase")
login_events = parsed_events.filter(col("event_type") == "login")

# Aggregate metrics in real-time
purchase_metrics = purchase_events \
    .withWatermark("timestamp", "1 minute") \
    .groupBy(window(col("timestamp"), "5 minutes"), col("properties.product_category")) \
    .agg(count("*").alias("purchase_count"), sum("properties.amount").alias("total_revenue"))

# Output to sink
query = purchase_metrics.writeStream \
    .outputMode("update") \
